# Data-analysis-visualization

This is a collective repository of all my data analysis projects and visualizations done using matplotlib and seaborns. 
Using python, i have been able to perform analysis on real world data from companies like Uber, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney, Youtube, McDonalds, American Universities and Austrialian shopping carts. From these analysis i am able to draw insightful findings and decision making that would help monitor and grow buinesses.

For example; we will use Python to answer questions such as:

# UBER
1. Check how long do people travel with Uber?
2. What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
3. Check The Purpose Of Trips
4. Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
5. What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
6. What Are The Trips In The Month

# YOUTUBE
1) Which category of videos have comments disabled ?
2) Which category of videos have ratings disabled ?
3) Most watched video in India overall | Year wise | Category wise
4) Yearwise number of Videos published which were trending
5) Distributions of Numerical Columns
6) View the correlations between the numerical variables
7) Plot the lmplots and regplots with numerical and categorical variables combinations and their relationship

# McDonald
1. Nutritional facts in their menu

# American University Analysis

1. Do universities with a high number of applications are the preferred ones by students?; in other words, could the number of applications tell us that a university is one of the most preferred by students?.
2. Do students prefer universities that have a high rate of admission?, in other words, do students prefer a university where it is easier for them to be admitted?.
3. Do students prefere public or private universities?
4. Do students prefer universities with low tuition and fees?
5. Do students prefer a university for its low on-campus cost of living?
6. Do students prefer universities from highly populated states?
7. Do students prefer a university because it belongs to a state with a high GDP per capita?
8. Do students prefer a university based on the possibility of a higher, additional academic degree in the same university?
