# Data-analysis-visualization



This is a collective repository of all my data analysis projects and isualizations done using matplotlib and seaborns. 
Using python, i have been able to perform analysis on real world data from companies like Uber, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney, Youtube, McDonalds, American Universities and Austrialian shopping carts. From these analysis i am able to draw insightful findings and decision making that would help monitor and grow buinesses.
