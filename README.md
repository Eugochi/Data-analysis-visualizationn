# Data-analysis-visualization



This is a collective repository of all my data analysis projects and visualizations done using matplotlib and seaborns. 
Using python, i have been able to perform analysis on real world data from companies like Uber, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Disney, Youtube, McDonalds, American Universities and Austrialian shopping carts. From these analysis i am able to draw insightful findings and decision making that would help monitor and grow buinesses.

For example; we will use Python to:

Check how long do people travel with Uber?
What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
Check The Purpose Of Trips
Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
What Are The Trips In The Month
The starting points of trips. Where Do People Start Boarding Their Trip From Most?
